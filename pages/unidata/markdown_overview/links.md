The general syntax to make a link is:

~~~md
[text of link](url){:target="_blank"}
~~~

When linking between markdown files, the `url` will be the permalink defined in the front matter of the markdown file you wish to link to (do not include a leading `/`).
Also, when linking between markdown files, drop the `{:target="_blank"}` markup, as we want pages of the tutorial to open in the same window.
