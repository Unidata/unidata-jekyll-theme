Each markdown file needs to start with some front matter.
For example, the front matter of this page looks like:

~~~md
title: Front Matter
last_updated: 2021-04-01
toc: false
sidebar: unidata_sidebar
permalink: front_matter.html
breadcrumbs: false
~~~

More information about front matter can be found [here](mydoc_pages.html#frontmatter).

## Specific to the Unidata theme

The Unidata extensions to the base theme added a breadcrumb feature.
By default, the breadcumbs are enabled.
To disable the breadcrumbs on a given page, set `breadcrumbs: false` in the front matter.
Note that this page was generated using `breadcrumbs: false` in the front matter of the source markdown file.
